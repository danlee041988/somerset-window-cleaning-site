# Google Ads Changelog

| Date | Update | Notes |
| 2025-09-29 | Added GA4 snapshot + key events to daily sync. | GA4 property 485470042 now tracks form_start/form_submit/quote_request/recaptcha_complete as key events. `scripts/ga4-daily-snapshot.ts` runs inside the daily sync to log 7/30 day counts in `docs/ads/history/*-ga4.json`; awaiting GA4↔Ads link to import conversions. |
| 2025-09-29 | Added GAQL reporting + keyword forecast utilities. | New scripts: `google-ads-report-search-terms.ts`, `google-ads-report-auction-share.ts`, `google-ads-report-cpc-trends.ts`, `google-ads-fetch-recommendations.ts`, and `google-ads-forecast-keywords.ts` for search-term/auction/CPC insights, pulling Google Ads recommendations, and estimating keyword bids. Daily review doc updated with optional steps. |
| 2025-09-29 | Automation running live with presence-aware postcode enforcement. | Enabled non-dry-run daily sync, guarded geo targeting for Search campaigns only, and confirmed 40 postcode sectors remain aligned across site + config. |
| 2025-09-28 | Declined Google “Add broad match keywords” recommendation. | Kept campaigns on current exact/phrase structure until conversion tracking is verified. Plan: verify tags, then run controlled broad-match test with tight negatives if needed. |
| 2025-09-23 | Initial growth plan documented; directories created (`plan.md`, `checklist.md`, `negatives.csv`, `keywords-seed.csv`, `measurement.md`). | Tier-2 areas, budgets, and CPA targets confirmed (Balanced profile). Awaiting final sitelink copy approval. Account ID confirmed as 447-417-5960. Conversion actions created via API: Quote (7315784824), Contact (7316082381), Phone Click (7316082384). |
| 2025-09-25 | Keyword sync automation added. | `scripts/google-ads-sync-keywords.ts` reads `docs/ads/keywords-seed.csv` and creates any missing keywords per campaign/ad group. |
| 2025-09-25 | Added automation scripts for plan enforcement & budgets. | `scripts/google-ads-apply-plan.ts`, `...-daily-sync.ts`, and helpers now live in repo; schedule or run manually once credentials confirmed. |
| 2025-09-25 | Expanded 100-keyword negative list (docs/ads/negatives.csv). | Scripts will sync the list across all search campaigns; rerun after any edits. |
| 2025-09-25 | Prepared legacy campaign cleanup script. | `scripts/google-ads-remove-legacy.ts` pauses/deletes the auto-generated UK-wide campaigns when approved. |
| 2025-09-26 | Refined negative keywords to avoid conflicts with downpipe service terms. | Replaced generic `downpipe` negatives with supply-focused phrases and re-synced to campaigns. |
| 2025-09-26 | Updated sitelink assets with dual-line descriptions and correct URLs. | Script now patches existing assets so Google Ads sees full text (`scripts/google-ads-ensure-extensions.ts`). |
| 2025-09-26 | Added health-check script to flag ad groups without serving assets. | `scripts/google-ads-health-check.ts` verifies enabled keywords/URL rules and ads during daily review. |
| 2025-09-27 | Attached "All visitors (AdWords)" audience list to every active ad group. | `scripts/google-ads-ensure-audiences.ts` keeps the observation list enabled so Google Ads Editor no longer warns about missing audience segments. |
| 2025-09-27 | Adjusted CPC bids for weekend test. | `scripts/google-ads-set-manual-cpc.ts` now sets Gutter £1.80, Conservatory £1.70, Solar £1.70 with Windows & Brand remaining at £2.00 to stimulate impressions. |
| 2025-09-27 | Created dedicated lead conversion actions (Quote, Contact, Phone). | `scripts/google-ads-create-conversions.ts` now provisions the GTM-linked Google Ads conversions (IDs 7320683703/7320683706/7320683709). |
| 2025-09-27 | Added Wedmore (BS28) to Tier-1 service area targeting. | Updated `config/google-ads/service-areas.json` and reran the daily sync so Wedmore is enforced for every search campaign. |

| 2025-09-23 | Added GTM workspace import file (`gtm-import-lead-conversions.json`) containing data-layer variables, triggers, and Google Ads conversion tags. | Pending import into GTM-WX8SLXJV and publish. |
| 2025-10-02 | **Launch Day 2 surgical optimization (friend's plan implemented)** | Analyzed historical data (Downloads/Overview_cards_csv 2025-09-27): Old campaign delivered £132.98 spend, 91 clicks, £1.46 avg CPC, 6.30% CTR (Aug 21–Sep 17). Top keyword: "looking for a window cleaner" (£67.85, 46 clicks). New campaigns (launched Sep 30) in learning phase: Windows campaign £1.28 spend, 24 impr, 1 click. **Actions completed (friend's plan A-G):** (A) ✅ Health check verified campaign structure. (B) ✅ Switched Windows – Somerset to **Manual CPC** for keyword-level bid control. (C) ✅ Applied surgical bid increases via `scripts/apply-bid-increases.ts`: High-intent keywords £2.50 ("window cleaning near me", "window cleaner near me", "looking for a window cleaner", "need window cleaner"), Town keywords £2.00 ("glastonbury", "street", "wells"). Updated 7 keywords successfully (1 already inherited correct bid). (D) ✅ Consolidated budget: Windows – Somerset increased to **£35/day** (from £25). Other campaigns remain at current budgets until Windows proves stable. (E) ✅ Synced 100 negative keywords across all campaigns, verified extensions (sitelinks, callouts, structured snippets, call assets), confirmed audience segments. (F) ✅ Set ad schedule: **Mon-Fri 08:00-20:00** (matching historical success pattern). Weekends paused to maximize weekday conversions. (G) ✅ Documented monitoring plan (see below). **Files created:** `docs/ads/bid-plan-2025-10-02.csv`, `scripts/apply-bid-increases.ts`, `scripts/set-campaign-budget.ts`, `scripts/set-ad-schedule.ts`, `scripts/check-ad-group-bids.ts`. **Success metrics (check by Oct 4):** ≥£20/day spend, ≥200 impressions/day, CTR ≥5%, avg position ≤2.5. If not met: +20% bid increase on same keywords. |
| 2025-10-02 | **Daily monitoring plan established** | **Schedule:** (1) Morning check (9am daily): Run `npx tsx scripts/google-ads-campaign-diagnostics.ts` → verify £20+ spend yesterday, check CTR ≥5%, note any policy issues. (2) Search terms review (Wed/Fri): Run `npx tsx scripts/google-ads-report-search-terms.ts` → add negatives for irrelevant searches (jobs, DIY, out-of-area). (3) Budget optimization (weekly): If Windows CPA ≤£25 for 7 days → re-enable Gutter (£10/day), then Conservatory (£7/day), then Solar (£5/day) sequentially. (4) Bid adjustments (bi-weekly): Keywords with 0 conv + ≥£75 spend → pause. Keywords with CPA ≤£20 + ≥2 conv → +10% bid. (5) Monthly geo review: Run auction insights, identify high-performing postcodes for future expansion. **Alert thresholds:** Zero spend 2 consecutive days = escalate to manual UI check. CTR <3% for 3 days = review ad copy relevance. |
