Read AGENTS.md before you start.
Process each message as a single task: plan briefly → implement → run lint/tests/build when they apply.
Report the diff and a concise commit message when checks are green.
Prefer `rg`, `sed -n`, and `git status/diff/show`; avoid new dependencies unless I request them.
Assume commands are pre-approved unless I explicitly say to ask first.
