Read AGENTS.md and STATE.md.
Process each bullet I give you in order; for each: plan briefly → change (≤2 files) → run lint/types/tests/build.
If green: commit and move to the next. If not: stop and report.

Cross-repo reads allowed. To operate in another repo, prefer:
  allow-run --cwd "$HOME/Projects/<repo>" rg "pattern"
  allow-run --cwd "$HOME/Projects/<repo>" jest
Writes outside this repo require an explicit absolute path from me, or WRITE_OUTSIDE=true.
