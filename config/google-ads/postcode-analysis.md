## Geographic Strategy Summary

### Total Coverage
- **42 unique postcode areas**
- **Estimated population:** 450,000+
- **Service radius:** Approximately 40-mile diameter across Somerset
- **Major hubs:** 4 distinct geographic clusters

### Recommended Budget Allocation
1. **North Somerset (BS):** £15/day (30%)
2. **Bath & Mendip (BA):** £12/day (24%)
3. **Taunton & Central (TA):** £18/day (36%)
4. **South Somerset (TA/DT):** £5/day (10%)

**Total:** £50/day ✅

### Location Bid Adjustments (Recommended)
**Premium Locations (+20-30% bid adjustment):**
- Weston-super-Mare (BS22-24) - High population, coastal affluence
- Taunton (TA1-2) - County town, commercial center
- Clevedon (BS21) - Affluent residential area
- Wells (BA5) - Historic city, premium properties

**Standard Locations (0% adjustment):**
- Most market towns (Frome, Bridgwater, Yeovil)

**Lower Priority (-10 to -20%):**
- Rural villages (BA8, BA10, TA12-14)
- Lower population density areas

### Coverage Gaps & Opportunities
**Well Covered:**
✅ All major Somerset towns
✅ Complete coastal coverage (Weston, Clevedon, Burnham)
✅ Strong Mendip Hills coverage
✅ Taunton Vale complete

**Potential Expansions (Future):**
- BA1-2 (Bath city) - Currently NOT covered
- TA21 (Wellington extended) - Partially covered
- BS areas north of Bristol - Not covered (correct - outside Somerset)

## Implementation Notes

### Location Targeting Method
**Recommended:** Radius targeting by major town + postcode exclusions
- **Why:** More flexible than postcode-only targeting
- **How:**
  - Set 10km radius around: Taunton, Weston, Frome, Bridgwater, Yeovil
  - Set 7km radius around: Wells, Glastonbury, Clevedon, Chard
  - Set 5km radius around: Smaller towns
  - Use postcode list as verification

### Competitor Analysis by Area
**High Competition (expect £3-5 CPC):**
- Weston-super-Mare
- Taunton
- Clevedon

**Medium Competition (£2-3 CPC):**
- Frome, Bridgwater, Yeovil, Wells

**Low Competition (£1.50-2.50 CPC):**
- Rural areas, smaller market towns
