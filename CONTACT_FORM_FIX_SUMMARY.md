## What's Working

- ‚úÖ EmailJS configuration is correct
- ‚úÖ Notion API is accessible and working
- ‚úÖ reCAPTCHA site key is now correct
- ‚úÖ Form has comprehensive debugging
- ‚úÖ Success message has been updated

## Next Steps

1. **Test in Browser**: The form MUST be tested in a browser environment
2. **Check Console**: Look for any error messages in the browser console
3. **Verify reCAPTCHA**: Make sure the reCAPTCHA widget loads and you can complete it
4. **Monitor Network Tab**: Check the Network tab in DevTools to see if requests are being made

## Common Issues to Check

1. **Ad Blockers**: Disable any ad blockers that might block reCAPTCHA or EmailJS
2. **Browser Extensions**: Try in an incognito/private window
3. **Cache**: Clear browser cache or hard refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R)
4. **Port**: Make sure you're on the correct port (usually 3000)

## If Still Not Working

Look in the console for specific error messages and check:
- Is reCAPTCHA loading? (You should see the widget)
- Are there any red error messages in the console?
- Is the submit button enabled after completing reCAPTCHA?
- Are there any network errors in the Network tab?

The comprehensive logging should help identify exactly where the issue is occurring.
